# Create B4X template from source
1. Archive the files inside "Web API" directory as "Web API Server (1.15).zip" using WinRAR or 7-Zip
2. Rename the extension from .zip to .b4xtemplate

# How to use
1. Download "Web.API.Server.1.15.b4xtemplate" from Release (https://github.com/pyhoon/webapi-b4j/releases). Rename it to "Web API Server (1.15).b4xtemplate".
2. Copy the "Web API Server (1.15).b4xtemplate" file into B4J Additional Libraries folder.
3. Open B4J and create a new project with "Web API" template. Give the project a name, for e.g. WebAPI
4. Run the project in Debug or Release mode. You will see something like this in the Logs:
```
Web API Server (version = 1.15) is running on port 19800
Open the following URL from your web browser
http://127.0.0.1:19800/v1/
```
5. Copy the URL showed in Logs and open it using your web browser.
6. To connect to MySQL server, go to Objects folder and open "config.ini".
7. Edit the root password at line #42 (second last line). Save the file.
8. In B4J project, comment the line '#AdditionalJar: sqlite-jdbc-3.39.3.0 and uncomment the line #AdditionalJar: mysql-connector-java-5.1.49-bin. (Make sure you are using the correct version of connector)
9. Follow step #4 to #5 above.
